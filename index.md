# About Me
---

Born in Southern California and raised in Mexico, where I completed most of my early education, I am currently pursuing my studies at Chapman University. I am majoring in Biological Sciences with a minor in Chemistry, focusing on Pre-med.

Academically I'm currently interested in Biochemistry, especially how the processes carried out by proteins underpin the very essence of life. Outside the classroom, I enjoy staying active by working out and playing basketball. I also have a passion for doing nails—an art I’ve perfected over time—and I participate in modeling, whether on runways or in photoshoots.
